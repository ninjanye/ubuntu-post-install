Ubuntu Post Install Script
==========================

This project provides a set of shell scripts to be run after a fresh install of
an Ubuntu(-based) OS. It will install your favourite applications, set your
preferred settings, etc.

##Usage:

Run from source folder:

    ./ubuntu-post-install-script.sh

Or if you like, add the script's location to your custom shell paths to run
on-demand.

	export PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/whereever/ubuntu-post-install/

Note: The included [preferences](functions/configure) and
[lists of packages](data) are those of the original author, you will have to
change them to suit yourself.
